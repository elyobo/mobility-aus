*Charts updated daily. Case data from government sources. The mobility data is ultimately derived from Google mobility resources; values of 1 reflect normal or 'COVID normal' behaviours, and values around 0 indicate peak lockdown behaviours.*

This portal provides access to Australia-oriented mobility datasets with the intention of aiding researchers and journalists and promoting a well-informed national conversation on public health. Established in early 2020 as part of the Doherty Institute-led initial scientific response to COVID, today the portal continues to update twice daily (typically with a two- or three- day delay) and offers both analytical products and bulk datasets on the changes in human movement through and beyond the lockdowns.

This portal was recently rebuilt from the ground up, and additional features will continue to be added or readded every couple of days. Much more can be made available upon request; media enquiries are also welcome. Email <rohan.byrne@unimelb.edu.au>.
